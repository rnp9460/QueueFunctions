# QueueFunctions
Template created by Instructor R. W. Melton

This code written in ARM assembly creates a queue and adds functionality to check the status of the queue as well as be able to clear and print it. 
Using the MKL05Z4 device, and PUTTY application terminal emulatar, characters a queue functionality was made with other functions such as UART0 polling and 
character I/O. 

Some help was recieved from Instructor in testing and debugging the code.
